 <h2> <br> SAP HANA On Demand for Premise and Cloud </h2>
 <div>
  
  SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform that is deployable as an on-premise appliance, or in the cloud. <br>
  
  It is a revolutionary platform, which is best suited for performing real-time analytics, developing and deploying real-time applications.

  <br> At the core of this real-time data platform is the SAP HANA database, which is fundamentally different from any other database engine in the market today. 
  <br>
  
  <p>
   SAP HANA does most of its calculations in-memory at the database layer instead of the application layer as done traditionally. 
   
   SAP HANA is not just a database. It consists of different engines that crunch calculations efficiently and return results to the application layer.

Due to this push-down of logic, the data latency (Time taken between request and response) is really small and thatâ€™s where the true magic lies.

SAP HANA opens up possibilities that were unimaginable with a traditional database which range from real-time status reporting of your inventories, 
   
   online analysis of streaming data from sensors, unrivaled predictive analysis capabilities and many more.
