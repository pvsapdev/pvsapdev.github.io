 <h2> <br> SAP HANA On Demand for Premise and Cloud </h2>
 <div>
  
  SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform that is deployable as an on-premise appliance, or in the cloud. <br>
  
  It is a revolutionary platform, which is best suited for performing real-time analytics, developing and deploying real-time applications.

  <br> At the core of this real-time data platform is the SAP HANA database, which is fundamentally different from any other database engine in the market today. 
  <br>
  
  <p>
   SAP HANA does most of its calculations in-memory at the database layer instead of the application layer as done traditionally. 
   
   SAP HANA is not just a database. It consists of different engines that crunch calculations efficiently and return results to the application layer.

Due to this push-down of logic, the data latency (Time taken between request and response) is really small and that’s where the true magic lies.

SAP HANA opens up possibilities that were unimaginable with a traditional database which range from real-time status reporting of your inventories, 
   
   online analysis of streaming data from sensors, unrivaled predictive analysis capabilities and many more.

   A company’s transaction data may be spread across systems, stored in different formats in each of them and may not be in the format that the management needs to see in their reports. 
   For a business to actively understand it’s underlying problems, understand market trends, create forecasts and make decisions, high quality reporting solutions have to be created with the right Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the company being measured across time frames. 
   These KPIs and attributes that a decision maker would want are usually scattered across the database and more often than not, many of them need to be calculated from the existing data. 
   Data warehouses cater to these needs and SAP BW is a time tested solution for large and small business alike with standard content also available for multiple industry segments to reduce implementation time.
